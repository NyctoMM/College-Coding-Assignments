# College-Coding-Assignments
A collection of the code I wrote/used in my time at South Hills, sorted by language.

Java: Includes two subfolders, one for eclipse projects done during my Data Structures and Algorithms class, and one for Android Studios projects, done in the class of the same name.
PHP: All done during my PHP class, most files are pre-built by the teacher and we would finish certain assignments within them.
Javascript: Done mostly in my Internet of Things class, meant to pair with a Raspberry Pi 4. A specific folder, known as Weather API, using the openweather API, done with a youtube tutorial that is credited.
